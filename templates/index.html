                Often the stigma surrounding professional female companionship is wrapped up in a misunderstanding of what is actually being offered. As a busy professional, discerning man, you are looking for someone to spend your time with who already understands your life. Someone who does not need constant attention or to be coddled. Someone who wants to make you feel like an absolute king, and has no expectations for time commitments or emotional labor. Someone who can escort you to an important event and put all his attention on you, but isn’t intimidated by how you capture a room. This is the beauty of straight female companionship. You are paying for the time and company of someone you don’t have to hand feed. A woman who is educated, classy, and experienced. This may not be the thing for everyone. And those who do not understand often speak negatively about the experience because they believe it is something else. Our Terms & Conditions very clearly lay out what we do and do not offer and what you can expect on your date.

                A lot of the women have different rates.  You can find each female’s rates on their individual profiles.  If your are on the ANGELS PAGE just click on the female escort you like and there is an orange button that says view rates. The minimum booking for an appointment where the companion travels to your location is two hours and could be longer depending on travel time.
